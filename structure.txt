frontend:

    globally stored array of objects(users)
        these objects contain the name, the last message, the date and time of the last message, the unread count, notification settings and an id

    each chat has a locally saved array of messages those are sorted by having the corresponding id and a date
    when opening the chat, the messages get loaded from the storage and if the user scrolls up new messages lazy load

    msg object: {
        chatId: "username",
        text: "test",
        date: "23.02.2023",
        time: unix timestamp,
        send: boolean,
    }

    msg chunk object: {
        chunkId: "username-23.02.2023"
        messages: [
            {msg}, {msg}...
        ]
    }

    chats array: [
        chat object: {
            participants: [you, username]
            chatID: ""

            friendStatus: blocked, active, request,
            online: bool,
            typing: bool,

            notificationSetting: {
                muted: bool,
                muteUntil: unixTimestamp,
                archived: bool
            },
            lastMessage: {msgObject},
            unreadCount: number of unopened messages
        }
    ]






when a msg is send:

sender:
sends msg object to server with (msg, chat/username, unique id)

server: checks if user exists in db, (if not return user doesn't exist);
check if user is online, if the user is online send the message, if not store in db
when message is delivered, notify the sender that the message is delivered

recipient:
decrypt msg
checks if user is already in user list, if not create user obj and push to users list
try to load current chunk, if chunk doesn't exist create one
update the user obj (increment unread messages, update last message);
save the chunk to local storage


when sending documents -> always send files to cloud and send the recipient the link (user can decide when and if they want to download images)


user and key generation, auth flow, sessions:

if a new user is created, the client generates a key pair and send the public key to the server but stores the public key if the server need to request it again
biometric lock

combined method for storing key save (biometric and other factors)




create own cloud storage for undelivered documents like videos and images (encrypted)
